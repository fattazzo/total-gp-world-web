# :racing_car: Total GP world: results, rankings, updated timetables and comparisons from the season 1950 to the present.

### :checkered_flag: Goals
- **Responsive**: the layout fits for the web browser, tablet or smartphone.

- **Fast**: each call is cached until the season is changed, so only the first time the data are loaded remotely. This means less data usage and more browsing speed.

- **Collaborative**: At this time only :it: Italian and :gb: English are supported but everyone can contribute by adding their own language.

- **Open**: The project is totally open so everyone can contribute or
create a new one starting from the existing one. Anyone who does not know the programming will still be able to request new features that I will try to achieve.
